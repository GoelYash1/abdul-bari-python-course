1. dir can be used to find methods of a class dir(str)
2. help can be used to find how to apply a function help(input)
3. index and find difference is index will give error if a substring doesn't exist in the string, whereas find will output -1
4. If you use two print statements and don't want the next print to be in a new line then you can:
    print("abc",end="")
    print("def")
    output: abcdef
5. print has print(end="\n", sep = " ", flush = False, file = sys.stdout ) DEFAULTS and more
    flush is a higher concept something related to buffer
6. Sets cannot contain mutable objects
        s = {{1,2,3},[1,2,3]} not allowed
        s = {1,(2,3),"Hello", 45.67} allowed
7. * is used to make arguments to its right in function key word based and * cannot be at the end
   / is used to make arguments to its left in function positional based and / cannot be at the start
   fun(a,b,/,c,d) means fun(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4) is wrong as a and b cannot be key word based
   fun(a,b,*,c,d) means fun(1,2,3,4) is wrong as c and d cannot be written without key word mentioned
8. def fun(*args,a,b):
    print(args)
   args is a tuple and a and b are key word only
   i.e fun(1,2,3,4,5) IS WRONG, fun(1,2,3,a=4,b=5) IS CORRECT
-> def fun(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
   kwargs is a map and all the arguments are key word only
   i.e fun(1,2,3) IS WRONG, fun(a=1,b=2,c=3) IS CORRECT
-> def fun(*args, a, b, **kwargs):
        print(args,a,b,kwargs)
   fun(1,2,3,a=1,b=2,c=4,d=5)
9. functions are also objects for example show = print
    i.e show("Hello") is same as print("Hello")
10. def fun():
        count = 0
        def counter():
            nonlocal count
            count+=1
        return counter
    This is a closure function and nonlocal is used to update the count on repeated calls like
    c1 = fun()
    print(c1(), c1(), c1()) # 1 2 3
11. ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, IndexError, KeyError,     ValueError
    10/0               10/'x'     l = [1,2]   d = {1:'one'} int('xyz')
                                  l[4]        d[2]
12. Modes of opening a file, r -> To read data from file.
                             w -> To write data from file. It overrides the previous data if it is closed and opened again
                             a -> To append data to the file
                             r+ -> To read and write data to a file
                             w+ -> To write and read data into a file
                             a+ -> To append and read data of a file
                             x -> To open the file in exclusive creation mode
->  Pickle has main two functions pickle.dumps(object, file)
                                  pickle.load(file) (one by one object)
    Can be used for objects
13. Python support function overloading without writing two functions with same name and with the use of default values
14. a class can have a inner class and it will be called in the class using self.'classname'
15. interface and abstract class are similar but interface only has abstract methods whereas abstract class may have some concrete methods
16. Semaphore value decreases when a function is acquired and increases when released
17. OS module has many functions
        os.getlogin() gives who is logged in
        os.getcwd() gives the current working directory
        os.chdir() is used to change directory
        os.listdir() list of files inside a directory
        os.mkdir() makes directory
        os.makedirs() make nested directories
        os.remove() is used to remove a file
        os.rmdir() is used to remove a directory
        os.removedirs() is used to nested directories
        os.rename() can be used to rename a file or folder
18. Numpy array datatypes
    arr = np.array([1,2,3,4],{dtype})
    b - byte [-128,127] (128 will be -128 and so on)
    B - unsigned byte (natural number % 256)
    i - integer
    I - unsigned Integer
    f - float
    F - complex
    O - object
    S - string
    U - unicode character
    ? - boolean
you can also mention the dtype like int8, uint8, bool, longlong and more
